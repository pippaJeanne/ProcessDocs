### **Chapter 1: Introduction**

#### **1.1 Background of the Study**

* Introduces the broader research area within Digital Humanities.
* Discusses relevant historical, theoretical, and methodological contexts.
* Highlights digital tools, datasets, or computational techniques relevant to the study.
* Addresses the intersection of humanities research and digital methodologies.

  **Historical Context**

* Situates **Calvin’s correspondence** within the broader intellectual, religious, and political landscape of the 16th century.
* Discusses the role of letters in the **Reformation**, emphasizing their function as theological debates, personal exchanges, and strategic communications.
* Examines previous scholarly work on Calvin’s letters (e.g., how historians and theologians have used them to reconstruct his influence and networks).
* Introduces the history of Calvin’s correspondence collections, including **previous print and manuscript editions** and their editorial choices.

 **Theoretical Context**

* Engages with **epistolary studies**, exploring how letters function as historical sources and rhetorical tools.
* Draws on **network theory** to examine Calvin’s epistolary network—how his correspondents shaped theological and political discourse.
* Discusses **textual criticism** and the challenges of working with manuscript versus printed versions of Calvin’s letters.
* Considers **critical digital humanities** perspectives, such as:
    * The impact of digitization on how we access and interpret historical texts.
    * The limits of algorithmic approaches in understanding **tone, persuasion, or theological nuance** in letters. ?? (more in the sense of bringing out themes or determining similarity when asserting parts of text found in the copies but not in the original manuscripts are genuine or not [researcher's word is final])

 **Methodological Context**

* Explains the **hybrid approach**, combining traditional close reading with **digital techniques**:
    * **Network analysis** to map Calvin’s correspondents and identify influential figures.
    * **Text analysis (NLP, topic modeling, stylometry)** to detect recurring themes, shifts in tone, or discursive strategies.
    * **Geospatial methods (GIS)** to trace the movement of Calvin’s ideas across Europe.
* Addresses **challenges of working with historical texts**:
    * **OCR/HTR limitations** for early modern script.
    * **Editorial choices** in transcription and annotation.
    * **Linguistic variations** (Latin, French, regionalisms?).
* Discusses the importance of **open-access digital editions** and the implications of structuring data for reuse by other researchers.


#### **1.2 Problem Statement**

* Identifies a gap in existing research (e.g., lack of digitized sources, limitations of current analytical methods, underexplored datasets).
* Explains why a digital approach is necessary or beneficial.
* Frames the research problem within both the humanities and technological domains.

#### **1.3 Research Objectives**

* Defines what the study aims to achieve, such as:
    * Developing a new digital methodology.
    * Applying computational analysis to a humanities dataset.
    * Creating a digital edition, archive, or visualization.

#### **1.4 Research Questions or Hypotheses**

* Poses questions related to both the humanities inquiry and the digital methods used.
* May include hypotheses about how digital tools might reveal new insights.
* Addresses issues like data reliability, interpretability, or biases in digital methods.

#### **1.5 Significance of the Study**

* Explains how the research contributes to both humanities and digital scholarship.
* Discusses the potential impact on historical, literary, linguistic, or cultural studies.
* Highlights practical applications (e.g., improved digital archives, open-access tools).

#### **1.6 Scope and Limitations**

* Defines the dataset or corpus analyzed (e.g., specific historical texts, collections, databases).
* Clarifies limitations of the chosen digital tools or computational methods.
* Discusses challenges such as missing data, OCR/HTR errors, or technical constraints.

#### **1.7 Research Methodology (Brief Overview)**

* Summarizes the digital methods used (text mining, network analysis, GIS, NLP, etc.).
* Mentions the software, programming languages, or frameworks used (Python, R, TEI, etc.).
* Highlights interdisciplinary collaborations (if applicable).

#### **1.8 Structure of the Thesis**

* Provides an overview of the subsequent chapters, indicating:
    * How digital methods are applied.
    * How the findings will be analyzed.
    * Any accompanying digital outputs (e.g., databases, visualizations, websites).
